This category includes the wild elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragonlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerûn, wood elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclusive and distrusting of non-elves.</p>\n<p>Wood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green.

evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">hallow</span> spell.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.rRQpwAay3HXja1Mv]{Lay on Hands}</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.y5sYs2BpabTQPiVY]{Fighting Style}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.3FOrxR0oC5bXr158]{Spellcasting}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See <span style=\"color:#99cc00\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color:#993366\"><a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"Spells Listing (Paladin)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=4&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span> for the paladin spell list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.RVFKVW3GVa7EJPNT]{Divine Smite}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.iQ8kqbWqUxlmS6zi]{Divine Health}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.ibMB8JaCXjJVtkwH]{Sacred Oath}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.</p>\n<h4 class=\"compendium-hr\">Oath Spells</h4>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p>\n<h4 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity</h4>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.0JzPdkEMzJwJqQkp]{Ability Score Improvement}</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.EY4wgPaUuYWcFJpA]{Extra Attack}</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.zpgVX0l55FxWq6wC]{Aura of Protection}</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1).

This category includes the wild elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragonlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerûn, wood elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclusive and distrusting of non-elves.</p>\n<p>Wood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green.

class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See <span style=\"color:#99cc00\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color:#993366\"><a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"Spells Listing (Cleric)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=2&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span> for the cleric spell list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.</p>\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.oaauHSxTzfmgiIYv]{Divine Domain}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Nature}, Tempest, Trickery, or War. The Life domain is detailed at the end of the class description and provides examples of gods associated with it. See the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for details on all the domains.Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Domain Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each domain has a list of spells — its domain spells — that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.lCSKdsJUg3rK673x]{Channel Divinity}</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw.

Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You have advantage on Wisdom (@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Survival}) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.JSyBc83ROZWPrAbd]{Natural Explorer}</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.1ABKjyYwomRMTSkC]{Fighting Style}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. </p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.fmKaX7RCGYN1P8gs]{Spellcasting}</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{nature} to cast spells, much as a druid does. See <span style=\"color:#99cc00\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color:#993366\"><a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"Spells Listing (Ranger)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=5&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span> for the ranger spell list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spell Slots</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">animal friendship</span> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">animal friendship</span> using either slot.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{nature}. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.B5aSnFAFnET4PSwF]{Ranger Archetype}</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: the Hunter that is detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.Nvzy24LQCTYd3qPM]{Primeval Awareness}</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.m89KbazTVr1g1AgQ]{Ability Score Improvement}</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.2O9kwmXiUf4bL0Rb]{Extra Attack}</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.nQod71kacAeNpArj]{Land’s Stride}</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">entangle</span> spell.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.PcZEwtkgNuVmeLtt]{Hide in Plain Sight}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Stealth}) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.qOTLcg32avZDRWAP]{Vanish}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.Gve94nZTzP38wwtY]{Feral Senses}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You are also aware of the location of any @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Invisible]{invisible} creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Blinded]{blinded} or @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Deafened]{deafened}.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.C2WLPWmZ1Y7PMqQG]{Foe Slayer}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.</p>\n\n<h1>Starting Equipment</h1>\n<p

If your Dungeon Master uses the <a title=\"rules on firearms\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#Firearms\">rules on firearms</a> in the <em><a title=\"Dungeon Master’s Guide\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em> and your artificer has been exposed to the operation of such weapons, your artificer is proficient with them.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.i3gY8n22Vu3fF7bq]{Magical Tinkering}</b></p>\n<p>At 1st level, you learn how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have thieves’ tools or artisan’s tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.</li>\n<li>Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.</li>\n<li>The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.</li>\n<li>A static visual effect appears on one of the object’s surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.</p>\n<p>You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.DphbGhvJqbZw2Iui]{Spellcasting}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You have studied the workings of magic and how to channel it through objects. As a result, you have gained the ability to cast spells. To observers, you don’t appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you’re producing wonders using mundane items or outlandish inventions.</p>\n<h5 id=\"ToolsRequired\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Tools Required</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves’ tools or some kind of artisan’s tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an ‘M’ component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, “<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment\">Equipment</a>,” in the <em><a title=\"Player’s Handbook\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb\">Player’s Handbook</a></em> for descriptions of these tools.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p>\n<h5 id=\"Cantrips0LevelSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p>\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the <a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>THE MAGIC OF ARTIFICE</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don’t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you’ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal—perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Such details don’t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h5 id=\"RitualCasting\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.bCSiUz5Dwmnx80H8]{Infuse Item}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions. The magic items you create with this feature are effectively prototypes of permanent items.</p>\n<h5 id=\"InfusionsKnown\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Infusions Known</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn, choosing from the “<a title=\"Artificer Infusions\" href=\"#ArtificerInfusions-1131764\">Artificer Infusions</a>” section at the end of the class’s description. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the <a title=\"Artificer table\" href=\"#TheArtificerTable\">Artificer table</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.</p>\n<h5 id=\"InfusinganItem\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Infusing an Item</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a non-magical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion’s description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see “<a title=\"Attunement\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Attunement\">Attunement</a>” in chapter 7 of the <em><a title=\"Dungeon Master’s Guide\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>).</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the <a title=\"Artificer table\" href=\"#TheArtificerTable\">Artificer table</a>. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag of holding, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-lmop-class-features.FJZqz8FFF5dJbwzq]{Artificer Infusions}</b></p>\n<p>Artificer infusions are extraordinary processes that rapidly turn a nonmagical object into a magic item.</p>\n<p>The description of each of the following infusions details the type of object that can receive it, along with whether the resulting magic item requires attunement.</p>\n<p>Some infusions specify a minimum artificer level. You can’t learn such an infusion until you are at least that level.</p>\n<p>Unless an infusion’s description says otherwise, you can’t learn an infusion more than once.</p>\n<h5 id=\"ArcanePropulsionArmor\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Arcane Propulsion Armor</h5>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 14th-level artificer<br />Item: A suit of armor (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>The wearer of this armor gains these benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The wearer’s walking speed increases by 5 feet.</li>\n<li>The armor includes gauntlets, each of which is a magic melee weapon that can be wielded only when the hand is holding nothing. The wearer is proficient with the gauntlets, and each one deals 1d8 force damage on a hit and has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When thrown, the gauntlet detaches and flies at the attack’s target, then immediately returns to the wearer and reattaches.</li>\n<li>The armor can’t be removed against the wearer’s will.</li>\n<li>If the wearer is missing any limbs, the armor replaces those limbs—hands, arms, feet, legs, or similar appendages.

The item you infuse serves as the creature’s heart, around which the creature’s body instantly forms.</p>\n<p>You determine the homunculus’s appearance. Some artificers prefer mechanical-looking birds, whereas some like winged vials or miniature, animate cauldrons.</p>\n<p>The homunculus is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature’s game statistics in the Homunculus Servant stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.</p>\n<p>In combat, the homunculus shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Incapacitated]{incapacitated}, the homunculus can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.</p>\n<p>The homunculus regains 2d6 hit points if the mending spell is cast on it.

class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You have studied the workings of magic and how to channel it through objects. As a result, you have gained the ability to cast spells. To observers, you don’t appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you’re producing wonders using mundane items or outlandish inventions.</p>\n<h5 id=\"ToolsRequired\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Tools Required</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves’ tools or some kind of artisan’s tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an ‘M’ component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, “<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment\">Equipment</a>,” in the <em><a title=\"Player’s Handbook\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb\">Player’s Handbook</a></em> for descriptions of these tools.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p>\n<h5 id=\"Cantrips0LevelSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p>\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the <a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>THE MAGIC OF ARTIFICE</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don’t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you’ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal—perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Such details don’t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h5 id=\"RitualCasting\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Artificer","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"ZilUcGvcEgnX18Wm":3},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":1131501,"type":"class","dndbeyond":{"requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":4,"levelScale":null,"levelScales":[],"limitedUse":[],"class":"Artificer"},"class":"Artificer","importId":"4n12j9rmd6jh9zi1"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Artificer"}},"scene-packer":{"hash":"ac002a16da811bce41c40f4c51d4bab3978b5948"}}},{"_id":"X2djqXLuMdXYzTcF","name":"Background: Guild Artisan / Guild Merchant","type":"feat","img":"icons/skills/trades/academics-book-study-purple.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1>Background: Guild Artisan / Guild Merchant</h1><p></p><p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You are a member of an artisan’s guild, skilled in a particular field and closely associated with other artisans.
